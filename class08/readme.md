# Operators and Loops

Loops are used to check if a condition is true or false, and depending on the return value it runs a certain block of code inside of it several time until the return value becomes false, there are differnet types of loops simialr in functionality different in structure.

## Logical operators
1. And `&&`
2. Or `||`
3. Not `!`

### Comparison operators

The comparison operators are mainly used to get one boolean value output out of multiple inputs, and there are many operaters each has it's own job.

When we want to use comparison operators we need to write first operand then the comparison operators then second operand

1. Is equall to `==`
2. Is not equall to `!=`
3. strict equal to `===`
4. strict not equal to `!==`
5. greater than `>`
6. less than `<`
7. greater than or equall `>=`
8. less than or equall `<=` 

Is equal to: It's used to campare two variables to see if they are the same in value only `==`

Is not equal to: It's the opposite of _is equal to_ and it's used to see if two variable are not the same value only `!=`

Strict equal to: Similar to _is equal to_ but it checks if the two variables are equal in value and also typing `===`

Strict not equal to**: The exact opposite of _strict equal to_ where it checks if the two variables are not equal in value and also typing `!==`

Greater than: It check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right `>`

Less than**: It's the opposite of _greater than_ where it checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right `<`

Greater than or equal to: similar to _greater than_ but it checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right `>=`

Greater than or equal to: similar to _less than_ but it checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right `<=`
