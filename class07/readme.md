#JavaScript

* JavaScript can be used to select any **element**, **attribute**, text from an HTML page. To **_add_ elements**, **attributes**, and **text** to the page, or **remove them.


* Also it could be used to **specify a set of steps for the browser to follow** *(like a recipe)*, which **allows it to access or change the content of a page**.

* Browser compatibility is very important for the code to work so make sure to use a modern browser like Chrome or FireFox

* JavaScript is a programming langauge using **"Script"** as it's core principle, A script is a *series of instructions* that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. To **write** a script, you need to first **state** your **goal** and then **list** the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

i also learned about functions
 **Functions** let you **group** a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function *(rather than repeating the same set of statements)*.
